    "- **IdP (Identity Provider):** IdP is responsible for authenticating users and asserting their identities to the Service Provider (SP). It manages user credentials and provides authentication services. When a user attempts to access a service, the IdP verifies the user's identity and issues a SAML assertion (a security token) to the SP. This assertion contains information about the user's identity and attributes, which the SP uses to grant access to the requested resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SP (Service Provider):** SP relies on the IdP to authenticate users and provide identity information. It hosts the application or service that users are trying to access. Upon receiving a SAML assertion from the IdP, the SP validates the assertion, extracts the user's identity and attributes, and uses this information to authorize access to the service. The SP does not handle user authentication directly; instead, it trusts the IdP to perform this task securely.\n",
